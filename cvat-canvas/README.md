- It has been written on typescript
- It contains the class ```Canvas``` and the enum ```Rotation```

## Commands
- Building of the module from sources in the ```dist``` directory:

```bash
npm run build
npm run build -- --mode=development     # without a minification
```

- Running development server
```bash
npm run server
```

- Updating of a module version:
```bash
npm version patch   # updated after minor fixes
npm version minor   # updated after major changes which don't affect API compatibility with previous versions
npm version major   # updated after major changes which affect API compatibility with previous versions
```

```js
    const { Canvas } = require('./canvas');
    const canvas = new Canvas();
```

- Canvas has transparent background

Canvas itself handles:

- Remove point (PKM)
- Polyshape editing (Shift + LKM)

### Methods

All methods are sync.

```ts
    html(): HTMLDivElement;
    setup(frameData: FrameData, objectStates: ObjectState): void;
    activate(clientID: number, attributeID?: number): void;
    rotate(direction: Rotation): void;
    focus(clientID: number, padding?: number): void;
    fit(): void;
    grid(stepX: number, stepY: number): void;

    draw(enabled?: boolean, shapeType?: string, numberOfPoints?: number, initialState?: any): void | ObjectState;
    split(enabled?: boolean): void | ObjectState;
    group(enabled?: boolean): void | ObjectState;
    merge(enabled?: boolean): void | ObjectState;

    cancel(): any;
```

### CSS Classes/IDs

- Each drawn object (tag, shape, track) has id ```canvas_object_{objectState.id}```
- Drawn shapes and tracks have classes ```canvas_shape```,
 ```canvas_shape_activated```,
